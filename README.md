# wolf3D

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game, which
was the first FPS ever. It was made to explore ray-casting. The goal was to
make a dynamic view inside a maze.

This project is written with the help of minilibx library. Minilibx is a very basic graphical library
writting in C used in [42](http://www.42.fr/). To learn more about minilibx see https://github.com/dannywillems/minilibx.

To see it just run a Makefile.
To move around th map use arrows on keyboard.
